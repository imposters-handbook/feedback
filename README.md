# General Feedback for [The Imposter's Handbook](http://impostershandbook.com).

I'm tracking issues, feedback, corrections and general whatever here in this repository. The book itself is not available here, unfortunately.

## Found an issue?

I really do love and appreciate you for taking the time to help! It's pretty difficult to log typos/etc so if you could please add as much information as possible I'd truly appreciate it! There are issue templates so if you could follow one of those I'd appreciate it.
