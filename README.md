# General Feedback for [The Imposter's Handbook](http://impostershandbook.com).

I'm tracking issues, feedback, corrections and general whatever here in this repository. The book itself is not available here, unfortunately.

## Pre-Release Version

The current version is pre-release and your feedback is critical! I've put the book through rigorous technical review, but some things will make it through - and I really do appreciate any feedback you can offer.
